I keep thinking about AgriScan and how behind I am on the firmware. I still haven’t finished the sensor calibration, and the ESP32 keeps dropping WiFi when I’m logging data. On top of that I need to redesign the iOS dashboard because the current graph view feels slow and cluttered. I’m also worried about money since I’ve been ordering way too much prototype hardware from AliExpress. School is piling up too — I have an AP Calc quiz next week and I’m behind on physics problems. I really want to get better sleep but I keep staying up until 2am scrolling and then waking up at 6 to code. I also feel guilty that I haven’t practiced guitar in a week, even though it’s one of the few things that actually relaxes me. Overall it feels like I’m juggling startup work, school, health, and hobbies and dropping all of them a little bit. A little random too but I wanna learn the guitar? I used to play the viola and the piano but I slowly grew out of it I just wanna be doing something.
